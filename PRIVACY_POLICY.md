# Privacy Policy — Ancroo Browser Extension

**Effective date:** 2026-04-03
**Extension name:** Ancroo
**Developer:** Stefan Schmidbauer

## Summary

Ancroo does not collect, transmit, or sell any personal data. All user data stays in your browser or is sent only to services you explicitly configure.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`:

| Data | Purpose | Stored where |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Settings | Extension configuration (mode, provider URL, model) | `chrome.storage.local` |
| API keys | Authentication with LLM providers (Direct Mode) | `chrome.storage.local` |
| Workflows | User-created workflow definitions (Direct Mode) | `chrome.storage.local` |
| Hotkey bindings | Keyboard shortcut assignments | `chrome.storage.local` |
| Execution history | Last 50 workflow results for quick access | `chrome.storage.local` |
| Auth tokens | OAuth2 session tokens (Backend Mode only) | `chrome.storage.local` |

`chrome.storage.local` is sandboxed per extension — websites and other extensions cannot access it. The storage is not encrypted on disk; anyone with access to your browser profile can read it.

## Data Transmission

Ancroo only sends data to services **you** configure:

- **Direct Mode:** Your input text and prompts are sent to the LLM provider you selected (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Ollama). API keys are sent only to the corresponding provider endpoint.
- **Backend Mode:** Your input text, audio recordings, and file uploads are sent to the self-hosted Ancroo Backend URL you configured.

No data is sent to the extension developer, Ancroo servers, or any third party beyond your configured providers.

## Data Collection

Ancroo does **not** collect:

- Analytics or usage statistics
- Telemetry or crash reports
- Browsing history or page content (beyond what you explicitly select for a workflow)
- Personally identifiable information
- Advertising data

## Permissions

| Permission | Why it is needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| `activeTab` | Access the current tab for context menus and side panel |
| `sidePanel` | Display the workflow side panel UI |
| `storage` | Store settings, workflows, history, and hotkey bindings locally |
| `scripting` | Inject content scripts for text selection and hotkey handling |
| `clipboardRead` / `clipboardWrite` | Read/write clipboard when a workflow uses clipboard input/output |
| `contextMenus` | Add "Run with Ancroo" to the right-click menu |
| `identity` | OAuth2 PKCE authentication with self-hosted backend (Backend Mode) |
| `downloads` | Download files produced by workflow output actions |
| `declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess` | Override request headers for local Ollama CORS compatibility |

Host permissions for known LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter) and localhost are declared in the manifest. Custom backend URLs are requested via `chrome.permissions.request()` only when needed.

## Data Retention

- All stored data persists until you uninstall the extension or clear it manually.
- Execution history is capped at 50 entries (oldest are removed automatically).
- Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data.

## Children

Ancroo is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes

Changes to this policy will be reflected in this document with an updated effective date.
