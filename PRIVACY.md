# Privacy Policy — Ancroo

**Last updated:** 31 October 2026
**Developer:** Stefan Schmidbauer

Ancroo is a Chrome extension that runs your AI prompts on text from the page you
are viewing, through an LLM provider you configure. This policy explains what the
extension does and does not do with your data.

## Summary

Ancroo has no servers and no analytics — the developer never receives your data, and it is never sold. Your data stays in your browser, with one exception: the text you submit to an action (and the API key that authenticates the request) is sent directly to the LLM provider you configure.

## What data the extension handles

All data is stored locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`:

| Data              | Purpose                                       | Stored where           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Settings          | Extension configuration (provider URL, model) | `chrome.storage.local` |
| API keys          | Authentication with LLM providers             | `chrome.storage.local` |
| Actions           | User-created action definitions               | `chrome.storage.local` |
| Hotkey bindings   | Keyboard shortcut assignments                 | `chrome.storage.local` |
| Execution history | Last 50 action results for quick access       | `chrome.storage.local` |

`chrome.storage.local` is sandboxed per extension — websites and other extensions cannot access it. The storage is not encrypted on disk; anyone with access to your browser profile can read it.

### Data sent to your LLM provider

Ancroo only sends data to LLM providers **you** configure:

- Your input text and prompts are sent to the LLM provider you selected (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama).
- Your API keys are stored locally and sent only to the corresponding provider endpoint to authenticate your requests — never to the developer or any other party.

No data is sent to the extension developer, Ancroo servers, or any third party beyond your configured providers.

## What the extension does NOT do

Ancroo does **not** collect:

- Analytics or usage statistics
- Telemetry or crash reports
- Browsing history or page content (beyond what you explicitly select for an action)
- Personally identifiable information
- Advertising data

## Permissions

| Permission                            | Why it is needed                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `activeTab`                           | Read the active tab's URL/title and message its content script when you run an action |
| `sidePanel`                           | Display the side panel UI                                                             |
| `storage`                             | Store settings, actions, history, and hotkey bindings locally                         |
| `scripting`                           | Re-inject the content script into tabs that were open before install/update           |
| `clipboardWrite`                      | Copy an action result to the clipboard (copy-to-clipboard output action)              |
| `downloads`                           | Save the backup file when you export your actions/settings to JSON                    |
| `declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess` | Override the Origin header for local Ollama CORS compatibility                        |

The content script that reads your selection and inserts results is declared in the manifest and runs on all http/https pages and all their frames (so selections inside embedded editor frames, such as webmail composers, work too). It stays idle until you run an action or press one of your action hotkeys — it never reads or transmits page content on its own.

Host permissions for known LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter) and localhost are declared in the manifest. Custom provider URLs are requested via `chrome.permissions.request()` only when needed.

## Data storage and retention

- All stored data persists until you uninstall the extension or clear it manually.
- Execution history is capped at 50 entries (oldest are removed automatically).
- Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data.

## Children's privacy

Ancroo is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to this policy

If this policy changes, the updated version will be published at the same
location with a new "Last updated" date.
